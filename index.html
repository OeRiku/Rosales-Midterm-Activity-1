                        "rainbow". Each letter of Nizi forms a ballot box. JYP has said the group is made up of
                        "various people carrying different colors like a rainbow". The 'U' signifies the fans that
                        support the group. When pronounced a certain way, the name resembles "Need You" (nij-iu), which
                        JYP explained "People cannot succeed by themselves. Everyone needs each other and fans are
                        needed." <br> <br>

                        members around Japan, cutting the prospective lineup to 14 from 26 girls chosen by J.Y. Park;
